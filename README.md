# video_blender
Scripts to create automated videos from meta-data [timestamp:image_name] and linking an existing video

Keep in mind it is a video processor so usually uses peak 1GB or ram, requires h264 library to be on the syste to compress the videos. Optional [in-code] uncompressed for the people with infinite hard drives.

Also includes automater plotter for Veusz (application specific one + label specific one, but easily modifiable by example)
